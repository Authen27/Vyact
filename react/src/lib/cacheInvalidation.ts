// Vyact — local cache invalidation at the session boundary (v10.20.7).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// The local store is a CACHE of cloud state, but nothing ever invalidated it.
// Two consequences, both of which reached production:
//
//   1. PRIVACY. On a shared device, signing in as a second user left the first
//      user's cached households, transactions and accounts in localStorage. The
//      adapter reads the cache before the network answers, so the new user could
//      be shown the previous user's data.
//
//   2. GHOST ROWS. Rows that only ever existed locally — because their cloud
//      write had failed — were re-uploaded on the next sync and reappeared after
//      being deleted. `recurring_schedules` held ZERO rows in production for
//      months while devices rendered a full list and generated transactions from
//      it every week.
//
// THE RULE. The cache is dropped when it cannot be trusted:
//   • the signed-in user is not the user the cache was built for, or
//   • the cache was written by an older epoch (a deliberate, shipped reset).
// A routine re-login by the same user KEEPS its cache, so offline work and cold
// starts are unaffected.
//
// WHAT IS NEVER DROPPED. The pending write queue (`sync_queue`) — those are the
// user's own unsynced changes and dropping them would be data loss, which is the
// opposite of the point. They flush against the cloud after the purge.
