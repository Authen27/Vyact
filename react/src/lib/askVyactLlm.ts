// Ask Vyact — model-backed assistant (architecture P3).
//
// This replaces the deterministic classify (stage 3) and phrase (stage 5) stages
// with model calls. Stage 4 — `resolve()` — is deliberately NOT replaced: it
// stays the sole source of every figure. The model chooses WHAT to look up and
// says it in words; it never does arithmetic on money.
//
// That split is the whole safety story. A model that invents "you spent ₹42,000"
// in a finance app is a liability; a model that reads a computed figure aloud is
// not. `assertNoInventedFigures` below enforces it mechanically rather than
// trusting the prompt — prompts are requests, guards are guarantees.
//
// PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC by construction: the only outside dependency is a `ModelCall`
// function, so this module is fully testable with no network, no key and no
// provider, and swapping vLLM for anything OpenAI-compatible changes nothing here.

 *
