// Vyact — Ask Vyact response/tone layer (engineering spec §7, stage 5).
//
// This is the SECOND of the two seams a future LlmBackend swaps in (the
// `phraseResponse` interface, §3). Tone lives here and ONLY here — tuning the
// voice never touches extraction (stages 1–2) or computation (stage 4).
//
// Rules baked in (§7): answer-first, specific, open-ended (always a next step),
// warm-not-chummy, honest about estimates.
//
// 📖 BEFORE CHANGING COPY HERE, read `vyact-ask-vyact-responses-spec.md` at the
// repo root. It reconciles this file against the design deck in
// `WhatsApp & Ask Vyact Message Templates/…/Vyact - Ask Vyact Responses.html`
// and records which side wins where they disagree. Two things it settles that
// are easy to get wrong from this file alone:
//
//   * VARIANT COUNT IS NO LONGER UNIFORM. The ≥3 rotating phrasings stay only
//     for the turns a user actually repeats — capture confirmations and the
//     missing-amount ask. Everything else moves to ONE composed response in the
//     deck's four-part anatomy. Do not "tidy" one convention into the other.
//   * COPY CANNOT INTRODUCE A FIGURE THE ENGINE DOES NOT COMPUTE. A reply
//     carrying an unbacked number is DISCARDED by `assertNoInventedFigures`, so
//     it fails closed rather than degrading. Several designed responses are
//     blocked on engine work for exactly this reason — see §2 of that doc.

// ── Chips — the "next question", not navigation (deck §4, ticket #62) ──────────
//
// A chip is a follow-up the user can take in ONE tap. The design rule, verbatim
// from the response deck: *"Chips are the next question, not navigation. 'Why is
// it up?' beats 'Open reports'. Max three, and never a chip that just repeats the
// answer."*
//
// 🔒 A CHIP IS NEVER MODEL-AUTHORED. Chips are produced by `resolve()` (stage 4)
// alongside the figures, and are NOT part of what stage 5 phrases — the model is
// handed `result.vars` and nothing else. That matters: `assertNoInventedFigures`
// guards prose, not chips, so a model-written chip label would be an unguarded
// path for an invented number to reach the user. Keeping chip authorship in
// stage 4 closes that hole by construction rather than by another check.
