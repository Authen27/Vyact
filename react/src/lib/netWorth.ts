// Vyact — THE canonical net-worth projection (audit F3).
//
// BEFORE THIS MODULE there were three answers to "what am I worth":
//   • NetWorth.tsx — live account balances (correct, but only its own page),
//   • Dashboard selectors — the static `assets`/`debts` arrays (a new bank
//     account never moved the dashboard's net worth),
//   • Ask Vyact's SafeSummary — the static `assets` array again.
// A newly created account moved one surface and not the others; a standalone
// credit-card or loan ACCOUNT (which the account editor permits) contributed
// to NO liability figure anywhere.
//
// THE RULE (one source of truth)
//   ASSET side  — every cash/bank/investment ACCOUNT at its
//                 computed ledger balance, PLUS legacy assets no account
//                 represents (de-duped by assetId — liveAssetRows' rule).
//   LIABILITY side — every credit_card/loan ACCOUNT at its
//                 computed ledger balance (this is what makes a standalone
//                 card/loan account count), PLUS debts no account represents
//                 (de-duped by debtId), MINUS receivables the v10.17 rule
//                 excludes ('owed_to_me' never counts).
//
//   Every figure passes through the SAME currency conversion (format.convert
//   → dinero, USD-based rate table). Nothing here does ad-hoc FX.
//
// NetWorth.tsx, the Dashboard selectors and Ask Vyact's summary all read this
// projection. If you change what net worth IS, you change it here, once.

    // genuinely overpaid. Overpayment IS real money, so the row stays on the asset
    // side and net worth is unchanged; but it is a refund owed by an issuer, not a
    // cushion you can spend down, so it is 'short' and never counts toward
    // `liquidAssets`. Asserted by moneyModel.invariants.
