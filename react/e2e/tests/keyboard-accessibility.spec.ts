  // 🔴 REWRITTEN 2026-09-10 for the Aurora transaction form.
  //
  // The previous version tabbed through descriptionInput → amountInput →
  // currencySelect → categorySelect → memberSelect → accountSelect →
  // recurringSelect → noteInput → excludedCheckbox. That is not a renamed set of
  // controls; it is a different FORM. Aurora replaced the flat stack of selects
  // with an amount keypad, testid-driven category chips, and a progressive
  // "all details" disclosure that keeps currency/member/account/recurring out of
  // the initial tab ring entirely. None of those page-object members had existed
  // for months, and because `e2e` was excluded from typechecking the only symptom
  // was a 30s timeout naming the wrong problem.
  //
  // The expected order below was MEASURED against the running form, not assumed.
  // It asserts waypoints rather than every stop, deliberately:
  //   * the category row is a variable number of chips (8 today, driven by
  //     EXPENSE_CATEGORIES + "More"), so enumerating them would break on every
  //     category change — CON-UNIT-155..162 already pin that set;
  //   * `input[type=date]` consumes FOUR consecutive tab stops in Chromium, one
  //     per date segment. Verified as a single input (not four duplicates) before
  //     writing this, so it is browser behaviour, not a defect — but it is
  //     engine-specific and must not be hard-coded as a stop count.
